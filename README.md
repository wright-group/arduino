This repository is a collection of Arduino firmware codes used to interact with an Arduino and PC.
The codes are intended to be simplified and specific for key functions within the Wright group
experiments, and are generally intended for ease of use with the YAQ protocol.

To use: download/clone and upload to your Arduino firmware via Arduino software.

Current repository codes:
   arduino_do :  Firmware to configure an Arduino Micro for Digital Outputs.  Write to the DO pins
                 to turn them HI or LO using simple Serial type commands.  Reset the DOs if needed.
                 Examine the current bank of DO outputs if needed.
