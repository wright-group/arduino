This repository is a collection of Arduino firmware codes used to interact with an Arduino and PC.
The codes are intended to be simplified and specific for key functions within the Wright group
experiments, and are generally intended for ease of use with the YAQ protocol.

To use: download/clone and upload to your Arduino firmware via Arduino software.
